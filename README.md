## Weather Model
### Clustring :-
Clustring is a ML technique that involves the grouping of data points
Basic Algo for K-Means:
<li>Randomly pick K points to place K centroids</li>
<li>Assign all of the data points to the centroids by distance. The closest centroid to a point is the one it is assinged to.</li>
<li>Average all the points belonging to each centroid to find the middle of those clusters(center of mass). Place the corresponding centroids into that position.</li>
<li>Reassign every point once again to the closest centroid.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3-4 until no point changes which centroid it belongs to.</li>

Hidden Markov Models :-
The Hidden Markov Model is a finite set of states, each of which is associated with a (generally multidimensional) probability distribution.

Transitions among the states are governed by a set of probablities called transitions probabilities.

A hidden markov model works with probabilities to predict future events or states.
